{-| A simple application demonstrating how to use Form.Result.

This program shows a hypothetical "user registration" form, where the
user is expected to enter:

  - a username, which is required, and cannot be "admin" or "root"
    (which are "in use")

  - a password, which must contain at least one number, one letter, and
    one punctuation mark

  - a "confirm password" field, which must be identical to the password
    field

  - a "favorite fraction", where the user must enter a numerator and
    denominator, such as 1/5. The denominator must be nonzero and the
    fraction must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.

  - a "terms and conditions" checkbox, which must be checked

We also track the number of times the user has clicked "Submit". If
you had to try too many times, maybe we don't want you as a user!

Styling is left as an exercise for the reader.

{-| Many things can go wrong with the password.

I chose to represent this as a record because each could be true
sort-of independently of the others, but each can only be true at most
once and order does not matter. Depending on what kinds of things can
go wrong with your field, you might choose to have an error type that
was a List of some enumerated type. As long as you can build a Result
of it, Form.Result doesn't really care.

{-| The "Confirm Password" field only validates that the field is
present and matches the password field. The password field is
responsible for all other validations.

Note that the two passwords not matching could be conceivably a bug
with either field. In the README, I describe this kind of error as a
"bad combination" error, and I suggest multiple ways to handle
it. This is the "arbitrarily add it to one field" approach. In theory,
editing the password field could resolve this problem, but to make
that work correctly, I would have to add special-case code to the
UpdatePassword handler, and I didn't. This means if you change the
first password field to match the confirm, we don't clear the error.

-}

{-| We also have a "bad combination" situation with the fraction
fields, since we want to ensure n <= d, but when it isn't, it could be
because n is too big, or because d is too small. This is the
"introduce a field just for the combination" approach. We clear this
field's error when either the numerator or the denominator changes,
but we have to be careful to make sure to display this error, which is
easier to forget since it isn't attached to any specific output field.

{-| Verify that the confirmPassword is present and matches the

Because `()` doesn't contain information, we could have equivalently
written this as returning `Maybe ConfirmPasswordError`, with `Nothing`
representing "no problems", but I find it a little counterintuitive to
use `Nothing` to represent a valid outcome. Instead we use a `Result`
because `Ok` is clearly positive. Also, this lets us demonstrate
`Form.Result.checkErr`.
